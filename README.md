GLFWStarter
===========

This is the template that I build from whenever I want to play around with OpenGL.
It uses GLFW to handle the OpenGL context creation as well as user input, which makes things multiplatform and 10x easier.


I give anyone permission to do anything with this, as long as they don't hold me liable for any of my terrible code...
